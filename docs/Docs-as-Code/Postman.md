Simplify API testing and collaboration

Postman is an application that allows the testing of web APIs. The software was created in 2012 by Abhinav Asthana, Ankit Sobti and Abhijit Kane in Bangalore, India in order to solve the API tests sharing problem. Originally, it was developed as a plugin for Google Chrome, then a rich client, and finally a thin client.
